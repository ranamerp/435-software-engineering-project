The United States has suffered 265 climate disasters between 1980 and 2020 costing over 1.775 trillion dollars based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records. Based on an IPCC report, the direct risks of global climate change will have significant detrimental impacton urban areas. Responding to  natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, and wildfires, is a laborious task performed by on-the-ground emergency responders and analysts. In recent times,  social media has emerged as a low-latency data source to quickly understand disaster situations. An example of ongoing natural disasters are the two hurricanes in  the Gulf Coast and forest fire in California. The goal of this project is to create a tool that leverages Twitter as a social sensor to collect, analyze and  visualize disaster related tweets.
